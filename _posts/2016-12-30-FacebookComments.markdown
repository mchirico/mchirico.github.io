I started making updates to my Jekyll github page. What I really
only wanted to do was update the code formatting. Agreed. Jekyll
offers a lot of options...

Hmmm...okay, I'm big on communication. Maybe Facebook has additional
options that could make it better? Who knows... Below is an example
that allows for threaded conversations.

So if \_sass/\_base.scss

```css
code {
  font-size: 13px;
  border: 1px solid $grey-color-light;
  border-radius: 3px;
  background-color: #ffff;
}
```

```html
<a hfre="#">Hello world</a> <a hfre="#">Hello world</a>
```

```R
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(viridis)
library(Metrics)
library(glmnet)
library(formattable)

```
