## Technology and Open Government

This is a beautiful written law.

> The objective of the Right to Know Law ... is to empower citizens by affording them
> access to information concerning the activities of their government."  *SWB Yankees L.L.C. v.
> Wintermantel, 45 A.3d 1029, 1041 (Pa. 2012).*  Further, this important open-government law
> is "designed to promote access to official government information in order to prohibit secrets,
> scrutinize the actions of public officials and make public officials accountable for
> their actions."

Unfortunately, it requires some knowledge to use it 
effectively.  For example, it helps to review past cases to get a full 
understanding of this powerful tool, and that's where technology could be helpful.

## Search Past Cases

The first step is searching past final determinations.

[Final Determinations](http://www.openrecords.pa.gov/Appeals/FinalDeterminations.cfm)

[Metadata](http://www.openrecords.pa.gov/Documents/FinalDet/2020.pdf)

[Chirico v. CSD](http://www.openrecords.pa.gov/Appeals/FinalDetRecord.cfm?docket=2017-1984)

The following case is a nice summary that a citizen can submit multiple requests
to find out what is going on in Government.

[Harmon v. Londonderry Township](http://www.openrecords.pa.gov/Appeals/FinalDetRecord.cfm?docket=2017-2357)



[Bennett v. Bloomsburg Town](http://www.openrecords.pa.gov/Documents/FinalDet/29618.pdf)
